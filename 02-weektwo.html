      I live in a home for old people on Mars. I wake up in the morning feeling
      rhapsodic and youthful. I dress up, brush my hair, and apply my face
      cream. You feed Buck (or Pluto?), my tri-color Bassett Hound, three
      strawberries and a teaspoon of milk. My laundry room then explodes. I must
      evacuate.

      Well. That's okay. Luckily, as a Minecraft expert, I quickly retrieve my
      homemade DIY ender portal and push Pluto (or is it Buck?) in. I jump in
      right after. Now, all I have to do to get to my safe home is defeat the
      ender dragon and beat the game with no supplies on me. Easy.

      But wait! You might be asking... how does one even craft an ender portal?
      Perhaps you've found yourself in a similar situation. Perhaps you're just
      curious. Good thing this page gives you the straight DIY directions to do
      so. As we all know, in the game, ender portals can't be built. They must
      be found, and then attached to nine eyes of ender. Luckily, in Mars,
      things work a bit differently. All you really need here is some wooden
      blocks. As the house crumbles around me, I quickly open Adobe Creative
      Cloud.

    <p class=jump>
      After designing the dimensions, creating nine blocks with spaces for the
      eyes—I set to laser cut out. Once laser cut, I use wood glue to attach the
      bottom and sides. In order to give the illusion the portal would work, I
      decided to make an automaton-esque invention: <br>

      <br />
      I would spin gears that, when spun fast enough, would make the portal look
      alive. Figuring out how to do this was the most difficult part of the
      entire process. If I could redo the entire process, I would've created the
      portal and subsequent gears in Adobe and made sure the distances were
      logical. Because I had decided this on the spur of the moment, I had to
      measure with a ruler, guess, and hope for the best. Another thing I did
      not realize was that the prongs of each gear needed to be the same size.
      That was a hard lesson to learn.
    </p>

    <p class=jump>
      In order to create some texture and layers to the portal, I stacked gears
      on top of each other—creating two levels. When the mother gear was spun,
      the bottom wheel would spin the parts on the bottom, while the middle/top
      would spin gears that had been suspended up with a mixture of dowels and
      tears. Once that was done, I used the wood cutter to cut out several small
      squares, and glued them together in order to create height. These were my
      eyes. To make sure the eyes wouldn't just fall down, I glued a wooden
      dowel underneath all the rules.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, I painted each part, including the gears.</p>

      Unfortunately, I am really not that good at Minecraft, and so I died
      before reaching the safe house. However, I at least got a very cool
      website page.

      I painted the rendition of my last, final moments facing the dragon.
      Enjoy.
